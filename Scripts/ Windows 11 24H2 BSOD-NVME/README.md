# üõ†Ô∏è Windows 11 24H2 BSOD Fix Toolkit

A collection of scripts designed to address and resolve the Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) issues caused by improper Host Memory Buffer (HMB) allocation in certain SSDs, like the WD SN770 and SN580, on systems running Windows 11 24H2. These solutions help optimize the HMB settings and provide an option to reverse any changes if necessary.

## üìÑ Script Overview

### 1. **Solution_1.bat**  
**Purpose:**  
Reduces the HMB allocation in the registry to 64 MB (`HmbAllocationPolicy = 2`), improving system stability and mitigating BSODs.  
**Usage:**  
- Run the script as an administrator.  
- Follow the on-screen prompts.  
- Restart your computer after running this script.

---

### 2. **Solution_2.bat**  
**Purpose:**  
Disables HMB allocation entirely by setting the `HmbAllocationPolicy` to `0`. This is a more aggressive solution if issues persist after applying Solution 1.  
**Usage:**  
- Run the script as an administrator.  
- Follow the on-screen prompts.  
- Restart your computer to apply changes.

---

### 3. **Reverse.bat**  
**Purpose:**  
Restores the default HMB allocation settings by setting `HmbAllocationPolicy` to `1` (dynamic allocation). This script can reverse the changes made by Solution 1 or Solution 2 once a patch is live.  
**Usage:**  
- Run the script as an administrator.  
- Follow the on-screen prompts.  
- Restart your computer to revert the settings.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
- **Administrator Access**: Each script requires administrator privileges to modify the registry settings. Please ensure you run them as an administrator.
- **Restart Recommended**: A system restart is recommended after running any of these scripts to ensure the changes take effect.

## üí° What Does Each Script Do?
- **Solution 1**: Reduces HMB to a fixed 64 MB buffer (less aggressive).
- **Solution 2**: Completely disables HMB allocation (more aggressive).
- **Reverse**: Resets the HMB allocation to its default dynamic setting.
